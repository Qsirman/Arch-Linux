# ACPI

## What is ACPI
#### ACPI stands for Advanced Configuration and Power Management Interface,by using which we can get some information about hardware.

## Why ACPI
#### As we all know,almost every desktop environment has a status system.But I don't have any desktop.So before I make my own status system,I have to check my battery from shell.And that's why I need ACPI.

## Install
```shell
sudo pacman -S acpi
```

## Use
```
> acpi
Battery 0: Discharging, 76%, 05:51:47 remaining
```
